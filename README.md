# API ( Application Programming Interface)

1. API acts as intermediater between client and server.
2. It is as software which takes request from client to server and gives response back from server to client.
3. A simple example would be creating an account by logging into existing social media account.Example if you want to sign up for any new account on website you can simply sign in with your current google account or with facebook account.
4. Simply take our weather application example where we request weather forecast through Opeanweather API for particular city and it retrieve data from their servers. So there is no direct interaction between server and client. Everything is done through api. Simple as it is! ;)
